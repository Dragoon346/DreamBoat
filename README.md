# DreamBoat(name change coming soon)
Open world game I've been working on for a few months, no funding, no time limit.
I started this game as a large project for the game design class im taking at my highschool.
I don't plan on having it finished anytime soon, and im constantly coming
up with new ideas, both for gameplay and for code. This is going to be where I put any test builds
or code files/assets while I'm working, so that I can recieve feedback.
Thanks for checking me out
